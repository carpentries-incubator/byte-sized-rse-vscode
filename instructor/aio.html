<p>This session provides an introduction to Integrated Development
Environments (IDEs), powerful tools for software development. We will
explore how various features built into IDEs can streamline your
software development workflow, especially through their built-in
debugging tools — which allow you to identify and fix issues with your
code efficiently.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="what-is-an-integrated-development-environment-ide">What is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-an-integrated-development-environment-ide"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a graphical
application that provides a comprehensive workspace for writing,
editing, testing, and debugging code—all in one place. At the core of an
IDE is a code editor, and it combines several tools that developers need
into a single interface to streamline the code development process. IDEs
are extremely useful and modern software development would be very hard
without them.</p>
<p>Historically, developers typically wrote code using simple text
editors, often terminal-based with no graphical interface or syntax
checking support. They had to rely on separate tools outside the editor
to compile, debug, and manage their code, making development a much more
fragmented experience. It is worth noting that popular terminal-based
editors such as Emacs and Vim may appear deceptively simple at first
glance - but they are, in fact, highly powerful and customisable
frameworks for coding and automating development workflows.</p>
<p>Today, although some IDEs are designed for specific programming
languages, many modern IDEs can support multiple languages through a
wide variety of plugins — often created and maintained by the developer
community.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="why-use-an-ide">Why use an IDE?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-use-an-ide"></a>
</h3>
<p>An IDE brings everything you need to write, test, and debug code into
one place — saving time by helping you write better code faster. IDEs
help by:</p>
<ul>
<li>reducing setup and development time - everything you need for
editing, running, and debugging code is in one place and the need to
switch between different tools/applications/windows is significantly
reduced</li>
<li>offering helpful tools like syntax checking, code suggestions and
autocomplete, and error checking leading to fewer errors thanks to
real-time feedback and intelligent suggestions</li>
<li>making it easier to debug and test code leading to easier issue
detection and fixing</li>
<li>providing a consistent environment across projects</li>
</ul>
<p>For beginners, IDEs lower the barrier to entry by making it easier to
spot mistakes and understand code structure. For experienced developers,
IDEs boost productivity and streamline complex workflows.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="common-ide-features">Common IDE Features<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#common-ide-features"></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s look at what most IDEs offer - these features all work together
to make your life easier when coding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code editor with syntax highlighting and automatic code formatting
for better readability and consistency</li>
<li>Intelligent code completion that suggests syntactically correct
options as you type to speed up development</li>
<li>Powerful search tools to quickly locate functions, classes, or
variables</li>
<li>Inline documentation and reference lookup to understand symbols
(functions, parameters, classes, fields, and methods) and variables
definitions and usage without leaving your code</li>
<li>Built-in support for running and managing tests through integrated
testing frameworks</li>
<li>Seamless integration with version control systems (like Git) for
tracking changes and collaboration</li>
<li>Debugging tools for setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and
inspecting variables during runtime</li>
<li>An integrated terminal for executing commands directly within the
IDE</li>
<li>A project/file explorer for easy navigation and management of your
software project</li>
</ul>
<p>Some IDEs also offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deployment tools to package and release your code efficiently</li>
<li>Basic project and issue tracking features to support task
management</li>
</ul>

</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="what-is-code-debugging">What is Code Debugging?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-code-debugging"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now, what happens when your code does not work as expected? That is
where code debugging comes in. Debugging means finding, understanding,
and fixing errors in your code — which can manifest as unexpected
behavior, crashes, or incorrect outputs. Debugging is an essential step
in software development, ensuring that your code runs as intended and
meets its requirements (and quality standards).</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="why-debugging-matters">Why Debugging Matters?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-debugging-matters"></a>
</h3>
<p>Debugging ensures your code behaves as it should and helps you find
the root cause of problems — not just guess - when it does not. Even
small mistakes in code can cause unexpected behavior or crashes.
Debugging helps with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>code correctness</strong> - to ensure your program works as
expected and meets requirements</li>
<li>
<strong>error resolution</strong> - to help you understand why your
code is not performing correctly, allowing you to find and fix issues
that make your program behave incorrectly</li>
<li>
<strong>improving code quality</strong> - regular debugging leads to
cleaner, more reliable and performant code and reduces the risk of
problems in production</li>
<li>
<strong>efficient code development</strong> - familiarity with
debugging tools and techniques can significantly reduce the time spent
on troubleshooting and enhance overall productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Debugging is a normal part of the code development process - it is
not just about fixing mistakes — it is about understanding your code
better.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="common-debugging-techniques">Common Debugging Techniques<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#common-debugging-techniques"></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s be real — everyone’s code breaks sometimes. Debugging is just
part of the game. For starters, you can try <strong>rubber duck
debugging</strong> - a technique where you explain your code, line by
line, out loud — to a colleague or to an inanimate object like a rubber
duck. The idea is that by forcing yourself to verbalise what your code
is supposed to do, you slow down and think more clearly about each part,
which often helps you spot mistakes or logical errors you might have
missed when just reading the code silently.</p>
<p>In addition to talking to a rubber duck (which is surprisingly
effective), one of the simplest tricks is <strong>adding print
statements to your code</strong>: just printing out variable values or
messages at key points can quickly show you where things start to go
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Logging</strong> is another smart move, especially for bigger
projects, because it helps you track what your program is doing over
time and help diagnose issues that occur in specific runtime conditions.
A variant of logging is to use <strong>assert statements</strong> in
your code -</p>
<p>But if you want to level up, using a <strong>built-in
debugger</strong> (like the one in VS Code) is a game-changer — you can
set breakpoints, step through your code line by line, and actually see
what is happening in real time.</p>
<p>And if you really want to catch problems early, <strong>writing
tests</strong> to check that your code behaves properly can save you
from bigger headaches later.</p>

<p>Let’s start by running VSCode now on our machines, so run it now. How
you run VSCode will differ depending on which operating system you have
installed.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll likely see is a welcome-style page with links
to features for opening files, and creating or opening a project. You
may find it asks you which kind of theme you’d like - you can select
from either a dark or light theme.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>So let’s take a look at the application. You’ll see some icons on the
left side, which give you access to its key features. Hovering your
mouse over each one will show a tooltip that names that feature:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/vscode-overview.png" class="image-with-shadow figure mx-auto d-block" style="width:100.0%" alt="Screenshot of VSCode interface"></figure><ul>
<li><p><code>Explorer</code> - the top one is a file navigator, or
explorer - we can use this to open existing folders containing program
files.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Search</code> - the next one down is a search capability,
so you can search for things (and replace them with other text) over
your code files.</p></li>
<li>
<p><code>Source control</code> - this gives you access to source
code control, which includes Git version control functionality. This
feature means you can do things like clone Git repositories (for
example, from GitHub), add and commit files to a repository, things like
that.</p>
<div id="callout1" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<span class="callout-header">Callout</span>
<div class="callout-inner">
<div class="callout-content">
<p>If you’re not familiar with Git, that’s totally fine - you don’t have
to use this feature, although it’s worth looking into using version
control for writing your code. Version control Systems like Git allow
you to manage your code by storing it - and all the changes you make to
it - within a repository hosted elsewhere, for example, on GitHub.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p><code>Run and Debug</code> - this allows you to run programs you
write in a special way with a debugger, which allows you to check the
state of your program as it is running, which is very useful and we’ll
look into later.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Extensions</code> - which we’ll look into right now, allows
you to install extensions to VSCode to extend its functionality in some
way.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other features and ways to access them, and we’ll
cover key ones throughout this lesson.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="installing-extensions">Installing Extensions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#installing-extensions"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Extensions are a major strength of VSCode. Whilst VSCode appears
quite lightweight, and presents a simple interface (particularly
compared to many other IDEs!), this is quite deceptive. You can extend
its functionality in many different ways. For example, installing
support for other languages, greater support for version control,
there’s even support for working with databases, and so on. There are
literally tens of thousands of possible extensions now.</p>
<p>Now VSCode already comes with built-in support for JavaScript,
including TypeScript and node.js, but also has extensions for other
languages too (C++, C#, Java, PHP, Go, and many others). Installing a
language extension will allow you to do more things with that particular
language in VSCode, as we’ll see now.</p>
<p>Let’s install an extension now:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Firstly, select the extensions icon, then type in “Python” into the
search box at the top, and it’ll give you a list of all Python-related
extensions.</li>
<li>Select the one which says <code>Python</code> from Microsoft. This
is the Microsoft official Python extension.</li>
<li>Then select <code>Install</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>It might take a minute - you can see a sliding blue line in the top
left to indicate it’s working. Once complete, you should see a couple of
“Welcome” windows introducing you to two of its key features - support
for Python and Jupyter notebooks. If you use Jupyter notebooks, which is
a way of writing Python programs that you can run line by line from
within an editor as you write the program, you may find this useful.</p>
<p>For now, let’s configure this extension for our Python development,
and to do that, we need to tell VSCode which Python installation on our
machine we’d like it to use. In the Python Welcome window, select
<code>Select a Python interpreter</code>, and then
<code>Select Python interpreter</code>. You may find you have many
installations of Python, or only have one. Try to select the version
later than 3.8 if you can. Then select <code>Mark done</code>, and close
the Welcome window.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="a-sample-project">A Sample Project<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-sample-project"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>FIXME: copy code-style-example repo to softwaresaved’s
organisation</p>
<p>Next, let’s obtain some example Python and edit it from within
VSCode. First, download the example code we’ll use from <a href="https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/code-style-example/releases/tag/v1.0.0" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/code-style-example/releases/tag/v1.0.0</a>,
either as a <code>.zip</code> or <code>.tar.gz</code> compressed archive
file. If you’re unsure, download the <code>.zip</code> file. Then,
extract all the files from the archive into a convenient location. You
should see files contained within a new directory named
<code>code-style-example-1.0.0</code>.</p>
<p>Now we need to load the code into VSCode to see it. You can do this
in a couple of ways, either:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Select the <code>Source control</code> icon from the middle of the
icons on the left navigation bar. You should see an
<code>Open Folder</code> option, so select that.</li>
<li>Select the <code>File</code> option from the top menu bar, and
select <code>Open Folder...</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In either case, you should then be able to use the file browser to
locate the directory with the files you just extracted, and then select
<code>Open</code>. Note that we’re looking for the <em>folder</em> that
contains the files, not a specific file.</p>
<div id="what-about-using-git-version-control" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<span class="callout-header">Callout</span>
<div id="what-about-using-git-version-control" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">What about using Git Version Control?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>If your system has the Git version control system installed, you may
see a <code>Clone Repository</code> option here too. If you are familiar
with Git and wish to use this option instead, select it and enter the
repository’s location as
<code>https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/code-style-example</code>. Then
use the file browser that is presented to find a convenient location to
store the cloned code and click on
<code>Select as Repository Destination</code>, then select
<code>Open</code> when ‘Would you like to open the cloned repository?’
popup appears.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>You’ll then likely be presented with a window asking whether you
trust the authors of this code. In general, it’s a good idea to be at
least a little wary, since you’re obtaining code from the internet, so
be sure to check your sources! Be careful here - I found on Windows the
“Trust” option appears on the left, whilst on Mac, it appears on the
right! In this case, feel free to trust the repository! You’ll then see
the explorer present you with some files in a small window (or pane) on
the left you can use to navigate and find files.</p>
<p>So far within VSCode we have downloaded some code from a repository
and opened a folder. Whenever we open a folder in VSCode, this is
referred to as a “Workspace” - essentially, a collection of a project’s
files and directories. So within this workspace, you’ll see the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>data</code> folder, containing a single data file (click on
it to see the data file within it).</li>
<li>Two files, a <code>climate_analysis.py</code> Python file, and a
<code>LICENSE.md</code> file</li>
</ul>
<p>So next, let’s look at editing code.</p>

<p>Now we’ve acquainted ourselves with running VSCode, let’s take a look
at our example code. Select the <code>climate_analysis.py</code> file in
the explorer window, which will bring up the contents of the file in the
code editor.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">The File Explorer has Disappeared!</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>You may find, perhaps on reopening VSCode, that the explorer is no
longer visible. In this case, you can select <code>Explorer</code> from
the sidebar to bring it back up again, and if you don’t currently have a
workspace loaded, you can select <code>Open Folder</code> to select the
code folder.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Note that as an example, it’s deliberately written to have flaws.
Things like the line spacing is inconsistent, there are no code
comments, there’s a variable that’s not used, and you may spot other
issues too. But in essence, the code is designed to do the
following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open a file in the CSV (comma separated value) format</li>
<li>Go through the file line by line, and:
<ul>
<li>If the line begins with a <code>#</code> symbol, ignore it.</li>
<li>Otherwise, extract the fourth column (which contains temperature in
Fahrenheit), convert it to Celsius and Kelvin, and output those
readings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of what the code editor gives us.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="syntax-highlighting">Syntax Highlighting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#syntax-highlighting"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>You’ll notice that the Python syntax is being highlighted for us,
which helps readability.</p>
<p>FIXME: add screenshot of code editor with syntax highlighting of code
example</p>
<p>Here, it uses colour to distinguish the various parts of our program.
Functions are yellow, Python statements are purple, variables are light
blue, and strings are this reddy-orange, and so on. Which, perhaps
unsurprisingly, is a feature known as Syntax Highlighting, and it’s
possible to edit the colour scheme to your liking for a particular
language if you like, although we won’t go into that now.</p>
<p>This is really handy to give you immediate feedback on what you are
typing, and can help you to identify common syntax mistakes. For
example, deleting the closing parenthesis on <code>open</code> - the
opening one goes red, with a squiggly line underneath, indicating an
issue.</p>
<p>So this is great, and helps us understand what we are writing, and
highlights some mistakes.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="code-completion">Code Completion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#code-completion"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Something that’s also useful is VSCode’s ability (via the Python and
Pylance extensions) to help you write and format your code whilst you’re
typing.</p>
<p>For example, on a blank line somewhere, enter
<code>for x in something:</code>.</p>
<p>On the next line, we can see that it’s automatically indented it for
us, knowing that we’re inside a loop.</p>
<p>Another really helpful feature is something known as code completion
(in VSCode, this is referred to as IntelliSense). This is a great time
saver, and a really useful feature of IDEs. Essentially, as you type, it
works out the context of what you are doing, and gives you hints. For
example, if we start typing a variable we’ve already defined, for
example <code>climate_data</code>, we can see that it’s zeroing in as we
type on the options for what we might be trying to type. When we see
<code>climate_data</code>, we can press <code>Tab</code> to complete it
for us. As another example, if we wanted to open another file, we might
type <code>new_file = open(</code>. In this case, it provides
information on the file <code>open</code> function and its arguments,
along with a description of what it does. This is really handy to we
don’t have to take the time to look up all this information up on the
web, for example.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="need-a-thing-install-an-extension">Need a Thing? Install an Extension!<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#need-a-thing-install-an-extension"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>As we just saw, included in the list of issues with our code was the
lack of docstrings. If we want to write good code, we should be adding
code comments, including docstrings for our functions, methods, and
modules.</p>
<p>Let’s try and find an extension that might help us with writing
docstrings. Select the <code>Extensions</code> icon, and type
<code>docstring</code> - you should see an <code>autoDocstring</code>
extension by Nils Werner at the top. Select that, and you’ll see a page
outlining what it is Also note via the number of downloads that it’s
very widely used.</p>
<p>What’s really handy is the little video that shows us what it does
This looks exactly like what we’re after! Select
<code>Install</code>.</p>
<p>Now, when we go to a function for example <code>FahrToCelsius</code>,
go to the next line, and add <code>"""</code>, we’ll see a small pop-up
to add a docstring. Press <code>Tab</code> to do so.</p>
<p>FIXME: add screenshot snippet showing docstring boilerplate being
added</p>
<p>It does all the hard work of adding in the structure of a docstring
for us, so we just need to fill in the blanks. This is another good
example of us realising it would be nice to have something to help us,
searching for an extension, and trying it out.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Using a Git Code Repository?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>For those of you familiar with version control and who retrieved the
example code via cloning its repository instead of downloading it, there
are some other editor features that help with using version control. One
of these is that the filename changes colours in the file explorer
depending on its status within version control:</p>
<ul>
<li>White - an existing file is unchanged from the copy in the local
repository).</li>
<li>Orange - the content of an existing file has changed, and the
change(s) have not been tracked by version control yet.</li>
<li>Green - a new file has been added and is unknown to version
control.</li>
</ul>
<p>So at a glance, you can get an idea of what’s changed since your last
commit.</p>

<p>So in summary, many of these editing features are typical of IDEs in
general, and the great thing is that they are really helpful at saving
us time. Things like syntax highlighting, code completion, automatic
code formatting and inserting docstrings, may not seem like much, but it
all adds up!</p>

<p>If you’re running an Anaconda distribution of Python on Windows, if

<p>VSCode has a sophisticated method to access it’s inner functionality
known as the Command Palette, which we’ll use to address this. Activate
the Command Paletter by pressing <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Shift</code>
+ <code>P</code> simultaneously, then type

to get a listing of files, for example.</p>
<p>We can also close this terminal/console at any time, and start a new
one by selecting <code>Terminal</code> from the menu and selecting

the option of never having to leave VSCode at all for most things.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now finally, let’s look at a feature with IDEs which is often
overlooked, that of the debugger.</p>
<p>A debugger is a bit like performing exploratory surgery on a patient.
You know there’s something wrong, but you don’t know exactly where the
problem resides. What’s useful with debuggers is that you go looking
within the codebase as it’s actually running to find the source of the
problem.</p>
<p>In order to run a debugging session we first need to tell the IDE
where we’d like to examine the code. Then you run the code in a special
way, using a debugger, and it pauses the execution of the code at that
point. You then have the freedom to take a look around and examine the
state of variables, which functions have been called up until this
point, and so on, and hopefully identify the cause of the issue.</p>
<p>Now, many people when starting out with coding disregard debuggers as
complicated and tough to understand. And 30 or 40 years ago, debuggers
were indeed quite complicated to set up and use. But these days,
debuggers are perhaps a little more straightforward, with IDEs doing a
lot of complex stuff for us.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="introducing-a-problem">Introducing a Problem<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introducing-a-problem"></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s assume we have a problem with our code - by introducing one. In
our <code>climate_analysis.py</code> code, where it says
<code>if data[0][0] != COMMENT</code>, replace <code>COMMENT</code> with
<code>'!'</code>. We perhaps might assume one of our colleagues
erroneously made this change, but we haven’t spotted it yet. We try to
run the code as before, and now it doesn’t work. We get a
<code>ValueError</code>, which informs us it couldn’t perform a
conversion of a value extracted from the data file to a float as part of
its temperature conversion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="adding-a-debugging-breakpoint">Adding a Debugging Breakpoint<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#adding-a-debugging-breakpoint"></a>
</h3>
<p>Now we know where the error is occurring but we don’t know the source
of the problem, which may not be in the same place. So let’s add in what
is known as a <strong>breakpoint</strong> to our code. This is where the
debugger will stop running the code and pause for us Let’s add it at the
start of the <code>for line in climate_data:</code> line. We do that by
clicking in the left margin for that line. By hovering in the margin,
you’ll see a faded red dot appear. Select it on that line and this sets
the breakpoint.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="using-the-debugger">Using the Debugger<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-the-debugger"></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s run the code using the debugger. Select the
<code>Run and Debug</code> icon on the left, and select
<code>Run and Debug</code>. Then it will likely ask two questions in
pop-up pane near the top:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It asks you to <code>Select debugger</code>, so select the suggested
<code>Python Debugger</code>.</li>
<li>Then it asks you to <code>Select a debug configuration</code>, so
select <code>Python File</code> to debug the current file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the Python script is running in debug mode. You’ll see the
execution has paused on the line we entered the breakpoint, which is now
highlighted., Some new information is now displayed in various panes on
the left of the code editor. In particular:</p>
<p>FIXME: show screenshot of debugging panes (esp. variables and call
stack)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>VARIABLES</code> - on the left, we can see a list of
variables, and their current state, at this point in the script’s
execution, such as <code>COMMENT</code> and <code>SHIFT</code>, and
<code>climate_data</code> (which is a reference to our open data file).
We don’t have many at the moment. It also distinguishes between local
variables and global variables - this is to do with the “scope” of the
variables, as to how they are accessible from this point in the running
of the code. Global variables can be seen from anywhere in the script.
And local variables are those that are visible from this point of the
program. If we were within a function here, we would see variables that
are defined and only used within that function as local variables only.
For example, if we set a breakpoint within the <code>FahrToKelvin</code>
function, we would see <code>kelvin</code> as a local variable, but it
wouldn’t be listed as a global variable.</li>
<li>
<code>CALL STACK</code> - this is a record of the journey the script
has taken, in terms of functions called, to get to this position in its
execution. It shows us that we are at the top level of our script, which
makes sense, since our breakpoint is at the top level of script, and not
within any function. If it were within the <code>FahrToKelvin</code>
function, for example, we’d see that added to the call stack. It also
shows us the line number where execution has paused at this level of the
call stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we can also see some new icons at the top to do with
debugging:</p>
<p>FIXME: show screenshot snippet of debugging icons</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is continue, which allows the script to keep running
until the next breakpoint.</li>
<li>The next one allows us to step over - or through - the script one
statement at a time.</li>
<li>The next two allow us to choose to step into or out of a function
call, which is interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we want to examine the inner workings of a function during this
debug session, we can do that.</p>
<ul>
<li>The green cycle one is to restart the debug process.</li>
<li>The red cross stops debugging completely.</li>
</ul>
<p>So let’s step through our code by selecting the second icon and see
what happens. As we do so, we can see the variable state changing. By
looking in the variables section, we can see that the <code>line</code>
variable contains the first line read from the data file. On the next
step, we’ve reached the <code>if</code> statement. If we step again, and
then again, our program halts because it’s run into the problem we saw
before.</p>
<p>This tells us something useful - that the problem occurs in the first
iteration of the loop. So, this implies, the problem might be with the
first line of data being processed, since the Python code is going
through the data file line by line. If we re-run the debugger, we can go
through this process again. And we can see something interesting when we
get to the <code>if</code> statement. From the code, we know that the if
statement is looking for an exclamation mark at the beginning of the
line to indicate a comment. However, the data variable contains a ‘#’ as
the first character instead. Therefore, in this case, the code will
assume it’s a data line and attempt to process it as such. And then it
will fail with the exception we saw before.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="fixing-the-issue">Fixing the Issue<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fixing-the-issue"></a>
</h3>
<p>So now we’ve identified the problem, we can fix it.</p>
<p>Firstly, stop the debug process by selecting the red square. Then
edit the <code>if</code> line to search for <code>COMMENT</code>
instead, reverting the code to what it was before. We can then rerun the
debugger if we wish, to check our understanding. And as we step through
the code, we can see if correctly identifies the first line as a
comment, and ignores it, continuing to the iteration of the for loop,
and the next line of data. Now we have our solution fixed, we can stop
the debugger again.</p>
<p>We’ve now solved our problem, so we should remove the breakpoint.
Running our code again as normal, we can see it now works as
expected.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Typically, we’d use debugging when we’ve discovered a problem. Other
techniques, such as testing, are great at identifying that there
<strong>are</strong> problems, but not always the root cause and
location of the actual problem. Debugging is the next step of that
process. Sometimes, we discover a problem - perhaps our code testing
show us there’s an issue, or maybe we find out some other way. If we’re
lucky, we can identify and fix the problem quickly. Where we can’t,
debugging is there to help us. With particularly complex programs, it
can be very difficult to reason about how they work, and where the
problem are, and debugging allows us to pick apart that process, and
step by step, help us find the source of those issues.</p>
